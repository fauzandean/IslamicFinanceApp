	with at least two independent parties, it must consist of an offer and acceptance relating to price and asset, acceptance 
	should match offer, the goods or services must be material effect(transfer of ownership) following exchange of asset and consideration(payment or fee)</p>
	<p>There are two types of contracts, <b>Compensatory</b> contracts is selling something to someone else for a price or other 
	compensation.<b>Non-compensatory</b> contracts are something given to someone else without any compensation, (Will or Donation).</p>

	<h5>Requirements</h5>
	
	<p>Contacting parties must be-Mature, adults and minors with parents or guardians, they must be sane and mentally sound at execution of contract </p>

	existence, the ownership has to by title or as a trustee and agent on behalf of the seller (constructive ownership). The seller should have the ability 
	to deliver. The Offer and Acceptance, where the offer is when a person proposes to buy or sell a good or asset from or to another (offeree) at a price. 
	Acceptance is when the offeree agrees with the price and specification of good or asset. Upon acceptance the parties are entering into a contract. </p>
	
	<h5>Conditions</h5>
	
	<p>Acceptance should be absolute and unqualified, sale attributed to future date or event would be void. The offer and acceptance should be in the 
	same meeting (Majlisul Aqd) if parties dispersed or an event occurs, then it is revoked, modern means of communications are allowed and if 
	offer is given until 4.00pm and acceptance is given before then it is valid.</p>

	<h5>Conditions which affect contracts</h5>
	
	<p>A sale with condition which is one of the requirements of the contract of sale is lawful and condition is valid. Ex: X will not 
	give keys until Y has paid X the full agreed price</p>
	
	<p>A sale with condition which in support of requirement of the contract is acceptable, buyer gives pledge in connection with 
	payment and gives some form of security (collateral)</p>

	<p>A sale with condition which is generally accepted by use and custom in market and is well known condition is acceptable, Ex: A buys

	but could eqaully be related to temporary use or property held in trust. Borrowing and obtaining benefit of tangible asset without

	transferred to recipient for free for a specified period. The benevolent loan (Qard). The will – Wassiyyat – bestows assets. Endowment – Waqf</p>

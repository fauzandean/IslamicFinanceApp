	<p><b>Sarf Foreign Exchange</b> rules apply to exchanging different denominations of the same currency 50 into 20 20 10</p>
	
	<p>Foreign exchange dealings is where trade conditions where both parties must take immediate possession, the counter values must be equal amount, 
	the contract shall not contain any conditional option or deferment clause, regarding the delivery of one or both counter values the dealing in 
	currencies shall not aim to establish a monopoly position currency transactions shall not be carried out on the forward or futures market.</p>
	
	<p>Conventional forward currency as impermissible, mainly due to the fact that deferring of the two exchanged currencies is in violation of spot 
	requirement in currency trading. So currency dealings cannot be done as forward sale contracts and consequently must be done a spot transactions 
	permissible to hedge against foreign currency exposures by recourse to the following</p>
	
	<p>To execute back to back interest free loans using different currencies without receiving or giving any extra benefit, provided that these two loans 
	are not contractually connected to each other (commonly known as an exchange of deposits).</p>
	
	<p>Where the exposure is in respect of an account payable, to sell goods on credit, example using a Murabaha transaction in which currency is not the 
	sellers own currency where the exposure is in respect of an account receivable, to buy an asset or goods on credit example using reverse Murabaha, 
	in future currency payment is in a currency which is not the buyers own currency. Thus forward currency for hedging purposes could be synthesized in 
	a way considered by most Shariah by Murabaha or reverse Murabaha to avoid currency dealings being used as disguised form of Riba</p>

	<h5>Sale of Foreign Currency</h5> 
	<p>The rules regarding ownership on the spot conditions at the closing of transactions the parties exchange the full amount of the counter 
	value in respective currencies ownership may be physical or constructive</p>

	receipt of cheque constitutes constructive ownership, providing balance in the account of the issuer 
	the receipt of a credit card slip by a merchant , signed by the credit card holder(the buyer is constructive ownership 

<hr>
<h5>Trading Currencies</h5>
<p> The foreign exchange can be executed using an agent with the authorization to take ownership or without authorizing. Modern means for 
communication, such as face-to-face, telephone, fax, email, online trading platforms, and offer transmitted by one of the prescribed means 
remains binding. Bilateral promise to purchase and sell currencies constitutes to forward transaction and is prohibited if the promise is binding 
even for the purpose of hedging against a currency risk. Unilateral promise is binding </p>

<p>The parallel purchase and sale of forward currencies is not permissible because of the following reasons;</p>
<p>No delivery and receipt of two currencies, thus amounts to deferred sale of currency. Makes one contract of currency of exchange conditional on 
another. Grantees for the protection of currency risk are not permitted between partners in Musharaka and Mudaraba. Exchange of currencies in the 
form of currency denominated debts. </p>
<p>Discharge of two debts when one party owes an mount to another party denominated in a different currency, at an agreed exchange rate(set-off)</p>
<p>A creditor receiving payment of a debt due to him in a currency different from that in which the debt was incurred, providing that the settlement 
is effected as a spot transaction at the spot exchange rate on the day of settlement.</p>

<p>It is permissible to execute a financial transfer of money (remittance) in a currency different from that presented by the applicant for 
the transfer. It is also permissible for the institution to charge a fee for the transfer. Forms of dealing in currencies via 
institutions – it is not permitted for the customer of an institution to enter into currency trading for an amount of money exceeding the 
amount of money he owns, use credit facilities granted but the institution which handles the currency trading. In addition it is not permitted 
for an institution to lend the customers a sum of money on the condition that currency dealing must be effected with that intuition and with any other.</p>

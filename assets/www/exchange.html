		<h5>Exchange</h5>
    </div>
	
    <div data-role="content" data-theme=''>
	<p>Similar to Barter trading where one good is sold in exchange of another good, in modern sale, a good is sold for money, or like in Sarf 
	where one currency is sold for another currency.</p>
	
	<p>Riba al Fadl exists in the exchange of two homogenous goods in unequal amounts and for future delivery or the exchange of two heterogeneous 
	goods for future delivery without taking immediate possession of the two exchange goods, albeit in unequal amounts which is permissible when 
	the goods are different. Primary condition is the total price and currency should be specified and agreed. Ex: If price is 50 in one month and 
	55 in two months it is uncertain</p>

	<p><b>Example of Exchange Contracts</b></p>
	<p><b>Cost Plus sale (Murabaha)</b> is a profit disclosed sale where the price of good, the markup and delivery date and payment date all are specified. 
	The sale is immediate against future payment. The advantage for the buyer to generate profit and repay original seller. Asset can vary excluding 
	Gold, Silver and other Shariah Prohibited Items</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p><b>Negotiated Price Contract (Musawama) </b>it is similar to Murabaha, except the buyer does not know the sellers price or profit (market stall)</p>
	
	<hr>

	<p><b>Foreign exchange (Sarf) </b>is trade between gold, silver and currency. Where one currency is sold in exchange of another generally referred 
	as currency exchange contract and it is exchanged on the spot</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p><b>Short term production finance (Salam) </b> is where spot payment is paid in full for the purchase of assets which have commodity like 
	characteristics such as base metals, copper and zinc and grain promised for future delivery. Agreed price is paid fully in advance, while delivery of 
	goods is deferred. The Salam seller is required to deliver assets to the specified type, quality and quantity. The Salam buyer expects 
	that his future price will go up so takes risk. In Salam transaction the goods must be freely available in the market. The Salam contract 
	specifies the quantity, the quality, the date and place of delivery. Salam cannot be used for spot delivery, might also be called future 
	delivery, pre financing and has been applied notably in agricultural sector.</p>
	<p>2 major exemptions;</p>
	<p>The asset does not have to exist, the seller need not have ownership of the asset (minimum Salam period is not less than 30 days)</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p><b>Long term production finance (Istisn'a)</b> - Asset is transacted before it comes into existence, Gharar is avoided by detailing the product details.
	It is the most flexible in terms of payment and delivery, there is an open field for negotiation, and the asset is to be built according 
	to the buyerâ€™s specification and to be delivered on specified date at a fixed price. Payment may be made in lump sum in advance or progressively 
	in accordance with the progress made. </p>
	<p>The delivery schedule and purchase price are agreed at the outset and taken into account aspects such as material, labor, profit margin, 
	and other project costs. Settlement takes place in Istisn'a on delivery of goods upon meeting specifications of the equipment, plant or project. </p>
	<p>The manufacturer and buyer enter into Istisn'a contract for the construction of an asset.</p>
	
	<p>The buyer agrees to pay the manufacturer upon completion of pre agreed stages of the construction. In the event the manufacturer is
	delayed or does not deliver according to the agreed specifications, he may have to pay penalty. At the end of the construction, the 
	asset is fully paid and owned by the buyer.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p><b>Down payment (Arbun)</b> is when a buyer makes a non-refundable down payment against the purchase price following sales contract, 
	the buyer enters into a contractual obligation to confirm the purchase, but loses the down payment if he does not conclude the purchase. 
	However if he continues with the purchase, the buyer only pays the difference between the agreed price and down payment he has already made.</p>

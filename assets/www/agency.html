		<p><b>Wakala Agency contract</b> is widely applied by banks and their clients. The concept ranges from brokerage services in permissible activities, to 
			funds management (as an alternative to Mudaraba) and underwriting management in Islamic insurance, to serving as the agent (Wakil) for the buyer or 
			seller on behalf of a contractor. In principal an agency contract is permissible with respect to all activities that are permitted to be discharged by the principle</p>
		<hr>
	
		<p><b>Disclosed Agent</b> is when an agent discloses his role to others. All documentation with the subject matter is done in name of principal, this is preferred</p>
		<p><b>Undisclosed Agent</b> is when an agent does not disclose, the suppliers cannot claim from bank but from agent. The agent has a fiduciary responsibility 
			and hence acts as trustee in holding the assets of the principal or in executing the service. Accordingly an agent cannot be held liable for any loss or damage 
			pertaining the assets or for any liability arising from the performance of the urgency contract unless such loss, damage or liability was caused by the agentâ€™s 
			negligence, misconduct or breach of the terms of the agency agreement.</p>

			<p><b>Islam</b> is a way of life prescribed by the Quran and Sunnah (practices) of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), the basics of Islam are the Iman which is belief, 
			Salah is the five times daily prayers, Sawm is fasting in the month of Ramadhan(Islamic Calendar), Zakath is the obligation of sharing the wealth with the poor, 
			and Haj is the pilgrimage to Mecca, compulsory to be done by every Muslim with wealth to afford it.</p>
			<hr>
	 
			<p>Islam can be broadly divided into three categories which are <b>Aqidah</b> (Faith and Belief), <b>Shariah</b> (Practices and Activites) and <b>Akhlaq</b> (Morality and Ethics).
			Shariah can be further divided into <b>Ibadat</b> (Worship) and <b>Muamalat Ammah</b> (Activities), which is divided into <b>Munakahat</b> (Marrriage), <b>Jinayat</b> (Crime) and <b>Muamalat</b>. Muamalat contains
			<b>Political</b>, <b>Social</b> and finally <b>Economical</b>. Islamic Finance and rules pertaining to this subject are derived from the economical section of Muamalat.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Commercial Ethics</h3>
			<h4>Stewardship</h4>
			<p>Wealth and properties are entrusted to man from Allah, and hereby responsible for the proper use and careful management.</p>
			
			<h4>Integrity</h4> 
			<p>Every act should be governed by strong morals and principles</p>
			
			<h4>Sincerity</h4>
			<p>Should be fair and sincere at all times </p>
			
			<h4>Piety</h4>
			<p>Be devout both in private and public </p>
			
			<h4>Righteousness and Perfection</h4> 
			<p>All people should try to do more than just perform occupational and professional duties and rather strive to reach righteousness and perfection in all
			their religious, social and economic obligations </p>
			<hr>	
		
			<p>Zakath and Sadaqah are charitable distribution, where Zakath in mandatory and Sadaqah is optional. The creation of wealth should be 
				linked to some kind economic activity and/or production. The capital is used as a factor of production and money as a medium of exchange 
				not a commodity in itself and is not considered to have an intrinsic value independent of the result of an investment or 
				transaction. Yields are based upon profit and loss sharing. The transaction is associated with an underlying asset or represents an investment in an 
				enterprise. Both Riba and Gharar are forbidden due to the fact that they cause imbalance in the economy and amongst people.

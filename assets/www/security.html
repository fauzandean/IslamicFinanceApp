	<p><b>Security Transfer (Hawala) Contract</b> is the transfer of an amount from one person (X-transferor) to another (Z the transferee) conducted 
		via trusted intermediary or agent who may charge administrative fee but this fee may not be  proportionate to the amount transferred</p>
	
	<p><b>Shariah conditions</b></p>

	<p>Absence of excess (Tafadul)</p>

	<p><b>Guarantee (Kafala)</b> makes the third party liable, alongside the original debtor, either concurrently or sequentially, if this was 
	stipulated by the guarantor in the security contract .Guarantors are able to charge administrative fees as long as it is not proportionate 
	to time or amount of contract. </p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p><b>Collateral Rahn-creditor</b> is when seller prefers to mitigate the risk of default by the debtor/buyer by taking collateral in the form 
	of a mortgage or pledge against an asset belonging to the debtor (registered pledge) or by taking physical possession of the pledged 
	asset itself (possessory pledge). May be sold for this purpose if the debtor does not meet the contractual terms of payment. Any 
	surplus proceeds in excess of the outstanding debt realized from the sale must be returned to the debtor. A pledge of collateral has 
	the advantage that the owner of the asset may continue to benefit from it, providing that he has the creditor's consent, while at the 
	same time using it as collateral to enhance his creditworthiness. Should the pledged asset become damaged or destroyed while in the 
	creditorâ€™s possession without any negligence or fault of the creditor, the creditor will not be held liable as the pledged asset is held 
	by him on trust.</p>
